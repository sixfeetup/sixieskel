sixieskel
=========

The sixieskel package is just a stub to install the actual templer based
packages.

You can install them with the following command. But if you are cool, you
probably would use virtualenv and pip to do so. I'll leave that up to you.

    $ easy_install -U sixieskel

This will provide the Six Feet Up templates that we use in every day
development.

As of this moment, this package will require some un-released templer
packages.
